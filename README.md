# Study and realization of a VLSI architecture of a processor implementing the FFT algorithm

Source files used to realize the processor architecture:

## src

VHDL files used to realize the RTL design of the processor

## matlab

MATLAB files used to simulate and verify the RTL design behaviour

## FFT_syn.tcl

Script used to synthesize in Design Compiler the architecture

## soc

Scripts used to realize the Physical design of the architecture in Innovus
